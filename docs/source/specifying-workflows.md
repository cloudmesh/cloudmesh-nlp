# Specifying Workflows

Users of cloudmesh cc must follow a certain
configuration style to best specify how a
workflow should be run. Customization options
include specifying the job types, the order of
how the jobs should be run, and the portrayal
of the graph.

## Workflow YAML format

A workflow yaml file with three Shell script
jobs `a`, `b`, and `c` is as follows:

```text
workflow:
  nodes:
    a:
       name: a
       user: gregor
       host: localhost
       kind: local
       status: ready
       label: '{name}\nprogress={progress}'
       script: test-a.sh
    b:
       name: b
       user: gregor
       host: localhost
       kind: local
       status: ready
       label: '{name}\nprogress={progress}'
       script: test-b.sh
    c:
      name: c
      user: gregor
      host: localhost
      kind: local
      status: ready
      label: '{name}\nprogress={progress}'
      script: test-c.sh
  dependencies:
    - a,b,c
```

## Example Workflows

Sample yaml files can be found at the following link:

<https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh-cc/blob/main/tests/workflow-example/workflow-example.yaml>

## Defining nodes in the workflow

Nodes can be customized in various ways within the
workflow configuration YAML file, including their
job types (python, sh, jupyter, or slurm), their
virtual Python environment (by specifying `venv`),
their appearance on the graph, and other characteristics.

### Defining labels for the workflow

These variables must be in curly braces when
defining the labels inside the yaml workflow files.

For example, a label could be defined as follows:

```text
workflow:
  nodes:
    start:
      label: 'start\nCreated={created.%Y/%m/%d, %H--%M--%S}\nWorkflow Started={t0.%Y/%m/%d, %H--%M--%S}\nNow={now.%Y/%m/%d, %H--%M--%S}\nElapsed={dt0.%M--%S}'
```

This creates a node on the graph that looks similar to
the following example:

![An example node with labels](images/labelmaker-example.png)

Initially, the created and elapsed labels are `N/A` if the workflow
has not yet started, but they are replaced during runtime. This
can be observed by running a workflow in graph view in the web interface.

Colons must be replaced with `--` and the years, months,
days, hours, minutes, and seconds can be arranged as desired,
as long as the corresponding letters remain consistent
(`%Y` `%m` `%d` `%H` `%M` `%S` respectively). Also, the
format of the time must come immediately following the period.

* `name` name of job
* `progress` progress of job from 0-100 
* time labels:
  * `now.` current time
  * `now.%Y/%m/%d, %H--%M--%S` now in particular format
    (this can be used for other times as well)
  * `created.` time when workflow was created
  * `t0.` workflow start time
  * `t1.` workflow end time
  * `dt0.` elapsed time since workflow began
  * `dt1.` total time of workflow once complete
  * `tstart.` job start time
  * `tend.` job end time
  * `modified.` job modified time
* `os.` operating system environment variable (like os.HOME)
* `cm.` cloudmesh variable that is read from `cms set`

## Defining format for timestamp labels

Various formats can be used for the timestamps, such as
the American datetime format `%m/%d/%Y, %H--%M--%S`
or the international datetime format `%Y/%m/%d, %H--%M--%S`.
As long as the letters stay consistent
(`%Y` `%m` `%d` `%H` `%M` `%S` for year, month, day, hour, minute,
and second, respectively), any format can be created.

If no format is specified following the period after the variable,
the datetime defaults to American format.

## Defining graphviz shapes and styles

Any shape and style for the nodes in the graph can be
chosen, as long as they are taken from the graphviz documentation:

<https://graphviz.org/doc/info/shapes.html>

<https://graphviz.org/docs/attr-types/style/>

The following is an example of a node in YAML format
that uses a box shape and an empty style. The empty style
defaults to `filled`, which allows the node to change color
when the job status is changed.

```text
workflow:
  nodes:
    start:
      label: 'start\nCreated={created.%Y/%m/%d, %H--%M--%S}\nWorkflow Started={t0.}\nElapsed={dt0.}'
      kind: local
      user: grey
      host: local
      status: ready
      exec: 'echo hello'
      name: start
      shape: box
      style: ''
```

## Defining dependencies in the workflow

Dependencies are specified in the order which jobs should be
run, from left to right. They are listed under the workflow
in the yaml file.

```bash
workflow:
  nodes:
    a:
       name: a
    b:
       name: b
    c:
       name: c
  dependencies:
    - a,b,c
```

## Reporting Progress

When running scripts/jobs inside a workflow, the scripts must 
leverage some format of cloudmesh.progress to run successfully. 
Otherwise, the Workflow class cannot tell
if the scripts are done, breaking the progress functionality.

The examples that are provided with cloudmesh-cc are
already augmented with cloudmesh.progress. Thus, if a user is
running self-made jobs and workflows, they must adhere to the
guidelines as follows.

## Shell and Slurm Scripts

For shell and Slurm scripts `.sh`, the script must contain:

```bash
echo "# cloudmesh status=running progress=1 pid=$$"
```

at the beginning of the script, and

```bash
echo "# cloudmesh status=done progress=100 pid=$$"
```

at the end of the script.

## Python Scripts and Jupyter Notebooks

For Python scripts `.py` and Jupyter notebooks `.ipynb`,
the script must contain an import module from 
cloudmesh.common and calls to the progress function.

py_script.py

```bash
from cloudmesh.common.StopWatch import progress
from cloudmesh.common.Shell import Shell
filename = Shell.map_filename('./py_script.log').path
progress(progress=1, filename=filename)

# your script does what you want it to do here...

progress(progress=100, filename=filename)
```

The statements do not need to be at the absolute beginning
or end of the script, but the progress must:

- be written to a filename with the same name as the script,
ending in `.log`
- begin at progress=1
- and end at progress=100
