Acknowledgments
===============

Continued work was in part funded by the NSF CyberTraining: CIC:
CyberTraining for Students and Technologies from Generation Z with the
award numbers 1829704 and 2200409. We like to thank the students that participated in the REU
for their help and evaluation in a pre-alpha version of the
code. We are excited that this effort contributed significantly to their increased understanding of
Python and how to develop in a team using the Python ecosystem.
