## Abstract

Natural Language operators are everywhere in technology. They aim
to relate machine learning and human needs for the better good of
a business practice or information system. These systems
are operated by large cloud providers such as Google, IBM Watson
and Amazon. The goal of this research is to highlight what services
these cloud providers offer. Another goal of this study was taking
what these operators can do considering machine limitations, and
implementing those services into a catalog called cloudmesh. This
catalog would then be able for reuse for data scientists, information
analysts, and other researchers. The design of this study was to
take a deeper look into the composition of language translation,
Text-Entity comprehension, and language conversion. Cloud providers
in modern day were our main focus, ex. Google, IBM, Amazon, and
Microsoft Azure. Our findings highlight the larger ability to use these
services in other forms of reproduction. Subsequently, starting a conversation for how these
services can benefit common business practices is a very important
subject in our research and should be continued past the initial 
research stages.
